# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker-and-Voltage-Estimator
● The project aims to design a dual-axis solar tracker employing an Arduino UNO microcontroller.
● We have used servo motors that control the movement of the solar panels in the X-Y axes.
●The LDRs or Light Dependent Resistors are used to detect the intensity of light falling on them. The resistors are used to limit the current flowing through the LDRs, protecting the circuit from damage.
● Finally, with the dual-axis solar tracker the solar panel's orientation can be adjusted precisely to face the light source, which results in a notable improvement in their efficiency
