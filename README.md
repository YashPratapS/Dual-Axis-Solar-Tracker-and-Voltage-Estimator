# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker-and-Voltage-Estimator
- The project aims to design a dual-axis solar tracker employing an Arduino UNO microcontroller.
- We have used servo motors that control the movement of the solar panels in the X-Y axes.
- The LDRs or Light Dependent Resistors are used to detect the intensity of light falling on them. The resistors are used to limit the current flowing through the LDRs, protecting the circuit from damage.
- Finally, with the dual-axis solar tracker, the solar panel's orientation can be adjusted precisely to face the light source, which results in a notable improvement in their efficiency

# Hardware used:
- Arduino uno : The main component of the board is the ATmega328P microcontroller, which is an 8-bit chip with 32KB of flash memory for storing program code and can execute up to 20 million instructions per second. This microcontroller is used in the  Arduino  because of its low power consumption and high processing speed. The board also features multiple input/output pins, including digital and analog pins that allow users to connect and control electronic components like sensors, actuators, and displays. The board's USB interface serves as a means for programming the board, communication with other devices, and uploading code to the microcontroller. The board also has a power supply circuit that enables it to be powered by an external source, such as a battery or DC adapter.

- Solar panel: A solar panel is an instrument designed to transform solar energy from the sun into electrical energy. It is Composed of numerous photovoltaic (PV) cells, usually made from silicon or other semiconductor materials, the solar panel functions by absorbing sunlight. As the PV cells absorb the energy from the sun's rays, they generate a flow of electrons, ultimately producing a direct current (DC) electrical charge.

- LDR sensors: LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors) are a type of sensor that alters its resistance depending on the quantity of light it receives. These sensors are passive and do not need an external power supply to work. They exhibit a high resistance when exposed to darkness and a low resistance when exposed to bright light, which allows them to determine the amount of light present in their surroundings. The simplicity and affordability of LDR sensors are one of their benefits. However, they may be affected by noise and interference from other sources of light, and their light sensitivity may differ depending on temperature and humidity.

- Servo motors: A servo motor is an electric motor that is utilized for precise control of an object's position. It consists of a rotor, stator, and control circuitry. The rotor and stator generate the motor's magnetic field, while the control circuitry monitors the motor's position to make the necessary adjustments. Servo motors are capable of rotating up to 180 degrees to provide precise control over an object's position.

- Resistors: Their primary function is to restrict the flow of current through different circuit components, such as motors, sensors, and control circuitry.
